# 🎯 Monotask

**Stop clicking, start focusing.**

Monotask is a high-performance, minimalistic time-tracking and deep-work companion. It was built for developers and creators who are tired of the "too many clicks" overhead in tools like JIRA, Zoho, or ClickUp.

## 🚀 Why Monotask?

Enterprise tools are built for managers; **Monotask is built for you.**

Time tracking in JIRA or ClickUp often feels like a chore—navigating complex UIs, multiple modals, and endless dropdowns just to log a few minutes of work. Monotask eliminates this friction:

- **Zero Setup**: No login, no project configuration. Just open and track.
- **Direct Action**: Mark tasks as done and track time in a single click.
- **Deep Work Focus**: A sophisticated "Midnight" theme designed to stay out of your way and keep your eyes fresh.

## ✨ Core Features

### ⏱️ Persistent Timer

Refresh the page? Close the tab? Your timer doesn't care. Monotask calculates and resumes your active session automatically, ensuring you never lose a second of tracked work.

### 📝 Smart Notes

A built-in scratchpad for your thoughts during focus sessions.

- **Auto-Sorting**: Completed notes move down, active thoughts stay up.
- **Multiline Support**: Jot down complex ideas with simple `Cmd + Enter` saves.

### 📊 Accurate History

View and edit your completed sessions with precision. Edit task names or durations in a direct `HH:MM:SS` format—no rounding errors, no guesswork.

### 🌑 Aesthetic Midnight Theme

A custom-tuned dark mode using OKLCH color space for a softer, more premium "midnight slate" feel that's easy on the eyes during long sessions.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon
